## Unit 1 - Characteristics & Classification of Living Organisms

### Mrs. Gren (Memorization is required)

**Most organisms has most or all of the characteristics mentioned below, but not all of them have all the characteristics at the same time**
  
|Letter|Characteristic|Definition|

|M|Movement|The ability to cause a change in position using the organism or part of the organism|
|R|Respiration|To break down nutrient molecules and make energy through metabolism|

|R|Reproduction|To produce more of the same organism|
|E|Excretion|To remove waste products from metabolism or excess material|

Carl Linnaeus: Father of taxonomy

#### Features of organisms
**Appearance**
- Number of legs

- Wings
- Beak

- **Not Colour!!**

**Anatomy**

- Organ structure

**Where it eats**
- Photosynthetic
- Carnivore
- Herbivore
- Decomposer

**Where it lives**
- Continental
- Island
- Under water
- Inside other organisms

#### Taxons (Memorization is required):
1. Domain

##### Vertebrates
**Animals with a spine**

*(In the order of evolution):*

**Fish**

![](/Images/Examples_Fish.jpeg)

- Scaly, slippery skin
- Uses gills to breath
- Lays shell-less eggs
- Movement with fins
- Cold blooded

**Amphibians**

![](/Images/Examples_Amphibian.jpeg)

- Slippery skin without scales
- Young uses gills to breath
- Adult uses lungs and skin to breath
- Young lives in water
- Adult lives on land
- Cold blooded

**Reptiles**

![](/Images/Examples_Reptile.jpeg)

- Dry, scaly skin
- Lays hard eggs (not as hard as birds)
- Cold blooded
- Uses lungs to breath
- Mostly lives on land

**Birds**

![](/Images/Examples_Bird.jpeg)

- Warm blooded
- Lays hard shelled eggs
- Has feathers and beaks
- Has wings so (mostly) can fly
- Uses lungs to breath

**Mammals**

![](/Images/Examples_Mammal.jpeg)

- Warm blooded
- (mostly) Do not lay eggs
- (mostly) Has fur or hair
- Most live on land and some live in water
- Uses lungs to breath

##### Arthropods
**Invertebrate animal with an exoskeleton, segmented body, and joint legs**

**Insects**

![](/Images/Examples_Insect.jpeg)
- 3 segments in the body 
- wings
- antennae
- 3 pairs of legs

**Crustaceans**

![](/Images/Examples_Crustacean.jpeg)

- 5-7 pairs of legs
- no wings
- antennae

**Myriapods**

![](/Images/Examples_Myriapod.jpeg)

- Many segments and many pairs of legs
- Long body
- Definitly no wings (it would be horrifying if they did)

**Arachnids**

![](/Images/Examples_Arachnid.jpeg)

- 2 segments in the body
- 4 pairs of legs
- no wings
- no antennae

##### Plants

###### Flowering Plants

**Plants that grow and repreduce with flowers**

![Monocots and dicots comparison](/Images/Examples_FloweringPlants.jpeg)

**Monocots**
- amount of petals = multiples of 3
- one cotyledon in seeds
- veins in leaves are parallel

**Dicots**
- amount of petals = multiples of 4 or 5
- two cotyledon in seeds
- veins are branched

###### Non-flowering plants

![](/Images/Examples_Amphibian.jpeg)

**Ferns**
- reproduce with spores
- no flowers

#### Binomial naming system
**A system of naming species developed by Carl Linnaeus in the mid 1700s**

First part = genus

Second part = species

Example: *Homo sapiens* - Binomial name of modern humans

#### Dichotomous Keys
**A table that classifies species with characteristics, each characteristic branching into two new ones to differentiate species**

![Example of a Dichotomous Key and how to read it from Encyclopedia Brittanica](/Images/Examples_DichotomousKey.jpg )

Example of a Dichotomous Key and how to read it from Encyclopedia Brittanica

#### Cladograms
**Similar to Dichotomous Keys, a diagram that differentiate species from a common ancestor**

![Examples of a Cladogram and how to read it](/Images/Examples_Cladogram.jpg)

Example of a Cladogram of dinosaur species

### Key Definitions
**Cladogram** - a branching diagram showing the relationship between a number of species according to their characteristics
**Cotyledon** - a small leaf within a seed that grows into a plant
**Dichotomous Key** - A table that classifies species with characteristics, each characteristic branching into two new ones to differentiate species
**Metabolism** - All chemical reactions that happens within cells
**Photosythesis** - A reaction occuring in the chloroplasts of cells, turning carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into oxygen, glucose, and energy. 
![Chemical Equation of Photosynthesis]()
**Species** - A group of organism which are able to produce fertile offspring
**Taxonomy** - A way to identify an organism and place it into the correct group with related organisms according to shared physical characteristics

## Unit 2 - Cell Structure

### Organelles of a Cell

|Organelle|Function|
|---------|--------|
|Chloroplast|Contains chlorophyll, which is used for absorbing light for photosynthesis|
|Cell membrane|A membrane that controls what enters and exits a cell|
|Cell wall|Protects the cell|
|Cytoplasm|Material inside the cell that contains all the other organelles, houses metabolism|
|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Network of membranes containing ribosomes that produce protein, including smooth ER and rough ER|
|Golgi Apparatus|Network of membranes in charge of controlling the transportation vesicles|
|Nucleus|Contains genetic material of the cell|
|Mitochondria|Aerobic respiration takes place here, producing ATP|
|Ribosome|Protein synthesis takes place here|
|Vacuole|A large vesicle found in plant cells to store water and minerals and keep the cell's shape|
|Vesicle|A capsule that can hold and transport substance|

### Types of cells

#### Eukaryotic Cells
**Cells that have nuclei**

- Animal Cells
(animal cell diagram)
- Plant Cells
(plant cell diagram)

#### Prokaryotic Cells
**Cells without a true nucleus including bacteria and archaea cells**

(bacterial cell diagram)

**Note that bacterial cells have different structures and organelles**

|Organelle|Function|
|---------|--------|
|Nucleoid|Naked DNA of cell|
|Plasmid|Extra circular DNA that can contain extra genes that give immunity to antibodies|
|Capsule|Another shell over cell membrane and cell wall the protects cell from antibodies and/or drying out|
|Flagella|Structure for movement|
|Pili|Structure for attaching to other cells|

#### Organisation of Life: 

Small>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Large

Cells -> Tissues -> Organs -> Organ Systems -> Organisms

**Not all cells contain all of the organelles stated above. They are different and specialized, each to do one job really well, so they only contain the organelles needed for that specific job**

#### Cells that we need to know

**Ciliated Cells** - contains cilia, small furs that can move mucus out of the trachea and bronchi

![](/Images/Examples_CiliatedCell.jpeg)

**Root Hair Cells** - large surface area, absorbs minerals thru active transport, absorbs water thru diffusion & osmosis, large vacuole for storage

![](/Images/Examples_RootHairCells.jpeg)

**Red Blood Cells** - no nucleus, large surface area, biconcave structure, transports oxygen in blood.
