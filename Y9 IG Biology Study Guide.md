## Unit 2 - Cell Structure

### Organelles of a Cell

|Organelle|Function|
|---------|--------|
|Chloroplast|Contains chlorophyll, which is used for absorbing light for photosynthesis|
|Cell membrane|A membrane that controls what enters and exits a cell|
|Cell wall|Protects the cell|
|Cytoplasm|Material inside the cell that contains all the other organelles, houses metabolism|
|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Network of membranes containing ribosomes that produce protein, including smooth ER and rough ER|
|Golgi Apparatus|Network of membranes in charge of controlling the transportation vesicles|
|Nucleus|Contains genetic material of the cell|
|Mitochondria|Aerobic respiration takes place here, producing ATP|
|Ribosome|Protein synthesis takes place here|
|Vacuole|A large vesicle found in plant cells to store water and minerals and keep the cell's shape|
|Vesicle|A capsule that can hold and transport substance|

### Types of cells

#### Eukaryotic Cells
**Cells that have nuclei**

- Animal Cells
(animal cell diagram)
- Plant Cells
(plant cell diagram)

#### Prokaryotic Cells
**Cells without a true nucleus including bacteria and archaea cells**

(bacterial cell diagram)

**Note that bacterial cells have different structures and organelles**

|Organelle|Function|
|---------|--------|
|Nucleoid|Naked DNA of cell|
|Plasmid|Extra circular DNA that can contain extra genes that give immunity to antibodies|
|Capsule|Another shell over cell membrane and cell wall the protects cell from antibodies and/or drying out|
|Flagella|Structure for movement|
|Pili|Structure for attaching to other cells|

#### Organisation of Life: 

Small>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Large

Cells -> Tissues -> Organs -> Organ Systems -> Organisms

**Not all cells contain all of the organelles stated above. They are different and specialized, each to do one job really well, so they only contain the organelles needed for that specific job**

#### Cells that we need to know

**Ciliated Cells** - contains cilia, small furs that can move mucus out of the trachea and bronchi

![](/Images/Examples_CiliatedCell.jpeg)

**Root Hair Cells** - large surface area, absorbs minerals thru active transport, absorbs water thru diffusion & osmosis, large vacuole for storage

![](/Images/Examples_Sperm-Egg.jpeg)

### Magnification

Magnification = image size/actual size

1mm = 1000um
1um = 1000nm

### Key Definitions
**Aerobic Respiration** - reaction that produces ATP using glucose and oxygen

## Unit 3 - Diffusion, Transport, and Osmosis


### Diffusion
**Particles move randomly due to Brownian motion, but there is an overall tendency to the movement, which is from high concentration to low concentration (down a concentration gradient)**

**Does not require energy**

#### Factors that affect rate of diffusion:**
- Temperature (higher temp = higher diffusion rate)
- Surface area (larger surface area = higher diffusion rate)
- Concentration (higher concentration = higher diffusion rate)
- Distance (closer distance = higher diffusion rate)

**Cells use diffusion to absorb useful substances and remove waste products**

#### Surface Area to Volume Ratio

Cells are small because they need to keep their surface area to volume ratio large. Large surface area to volume ratio means that each unit of the cytoplasm has less units of cell membrane. This is significant because if cells get too large, the rate of diffusion is too slow for particles to go through it when it is needed. To keep the surface area to volume ratio large, the cell has to stay small.

### Facilitated Diffusion
**Larger or charged particles that cannot diffuse straight through the cell membrane, and need protein channels to facilitate them. The protein channel can be opened or closed, so the cell membrane can control what enters or leaves the cell.**

### Osmosis
**Diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane**

- Movement from high water potential (dilute solution) to low water potential (concentrated solution)
- Solute cannot pass through membrane and also bonds with water, so water cannot go away when water potential is low

![](/Images/Examples_Solution.png)

#### Keywords
**Isotonic solution** - The water potential of the solution and cytoplasm is the same (no net osmosis)

**Hypertonic solution** - The solution's water potential is lower than the cytoplasm's (more concentrated). (osmosis out of the cell)  Animal cells will shrink; Plant cells lose turgor and becomes flaccid  

**Hypotonic solution** - The solution's water potential is higher than the cytoplasm's (less concentrated). (osmosis into the cell) 
Animal cells will swell and burst; Plant cells will have turgor

### Active Transport
**Movement of particles from low to high concentration (against concentration gradient)**

**Requires energy**

1. A protein with an active site that allows a specific molecule to fit in sits on the cell membrane
2. Energy in form of ATP is used to change the opening of the protein
3. The molecule is able to transfer to the opposite side of the membrane

### Key Definitions
**Brownian motion** - all particles move randomly, even without energy applied.

**Flaccid** - a plant becoming soft and drooping due to lack of water

**Turgor** - rigidness of plant cells when it has water due to its cell walls holding the pressure in
